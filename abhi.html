        <p>Welcome to Annaporneshwari Oil Mill, your trusted source for 100% pure coconut, groundnut, and sunflower oils.
            Our coconut oil is produced from coconuts grown on our own land at the mill, ensuring exceptional quality 
            from cultivation to extraction. We source our groundnut and sunflower oils from the village of Ranibennur,
             renowned for its rich agricultural produce. Utilizing the traditional Kannada gana method of cold 
             compression, we preserve the natural flavors and nutritional benefits of our oils, ensuring that every
              drop is packed with the goodness nature intended. All materials are meticulously dried using a state-of-
              the-art drier, which helps maintain their purity and quality throughout the entire process.</p><P>
